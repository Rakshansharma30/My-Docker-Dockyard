🚀 Docker Projects & Experiments 🐳
Welcome to the my-docker-graveyard Repository by Rakshansharma30!
This collection features Dockerized applications, including ML apps, databases, network experiments, and AWS deployments.

Each project showcases real-world use cases of containerization, helping you master Docker for software development & cloud deployments.

📚 Learning Resources
Here are some useful resources I frequently refer to:

📖 Official Docker Docs
🎥 Docker YouTube Playlist
📜 Docker Cheat Sheet

🛠 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

✅ Docker → docker --version
✅ Python (for Streamlit apps)
✅ AWS CLI (for EC2 deployment)

🚀 Projects & Experiments
Here are some exciting projects and experiments you can explore:

🔷 Streamlit Spiral Visualization: A Dockerized Streamlit app to generate interactive spiral patterns.

🔷 Binary Classification WebApp: A Streamlit-based ML app for binary classification using Logistic Regression.

🔷 Python Logging with Docker: Demonstrates best practices for logging inside a Dockerized Python environment.

🔷 Streamlit + PostgreSQL: Connect Streamlit with PostgreSQL database inside a Docker container.

🔷 MySQL Docker Container: Deploy a MySQL database container and connect it to applications.

🔷 Docker Network Experiment: Understand networking in Docker by connecting multiple containers.

🔷 ML Model Deployment with Evidently: Deploy an ML model with Evidently AI inside a Docker container.

🔷 Deploying on AWS EC2: Deploy Dockerized applications on an AWS EC2 instance.

🔷 Minikube with Docker: Run Kubernetes locally using Minikube with Docker.

🔷 Docker Bake: A Docker Bake implementation.

Feel free to explore these projects and experiments to learn more about Docker and its applications in software development and cloud deployments.

# My Docker Graveyard
This repository contains various Docker experiments and projects that I have worked on. Each experiment is designed to demonstrate different aspects of Docker, from basic containerization to more complex networking and deployment scenarios.
The projects are organized into folders, each containing a README file with instructions on how to run the experiments.
